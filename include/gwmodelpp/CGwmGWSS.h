/**
 * @brief The class for Geographically Weighted Summary Statistics. 
 * Geographically Weighted Summary Statistics is an algorithm for calculating local weighted statistics. 
 * They are local mean, local standard deviation, local variance, local skewness, local coefficients of variation, 
 * local covariances, local correlations (Pearson's), local correlations (Spearman's),
 * local medians, local interquartile ranges, local quantile imbalances and coordinates. 
 * 
 * To use this class, users need to follow this steps:
 * 
 * 1. Create an instance
 * 2. Set some properties, which are 
 *     - CGwmGWSS::mSourceLayer
 *     - CGwmGWSS::mVariables
 *     - CGwmGWSS::mSpatialWeight
 * 3. Run the algorithm by calling CGwmGWSS::run()
 * 
 * When finished, the algorithm will store those local statistics on each sample in different matrices. 
 * To get these matrices, call these functions:
 * 
 * - local mean <- CGwmGWSS::localMean()
 * - local standard deviation <- CGwmGWSS::localSDev()
 * - local variance <- CGwmGWSS::localVar()
 * - local skewness <- CGwmGWSS::localSkewness()
 * - local coefficients of variation <- CGwmGWSS::localCV()
 * - local covariances <- CGwmGWSS::localCov()
 * - local correlations (Pearson's) <- CGwmGWSS::localCorr()
 * - local correlations (Spearman's) <- CGwmGWSS::localSCorr()
 * - local medians <- CGwmGWSS::localMedian()
 * - local interquartile ranges <- CGwmGWSS::iqr()
 * - local quantile imbalances and coordinates <- CGwmGWSS::qi()
 * 
 * All these matrices are also in CGwmGWSS::mResultLayer, which is usually returned by CGwmGWSS::resultLayer().
 * These matrices are arranged according to the order above, their name is stored in the member CGwmSimpleLayer::mFields. 
 * 
 * For more details on how to use this class, see /test/GWSS/static.cpp or /test/GWSS/shared.cpp .
